Nice work, you committed a `Dockerfile`. You'll notice at the end of the Dockerfile, we refer to an entrypoint script.

```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

The `entrypoint.sh` script will be run in Docker, and it will define what the action is really going to be doing.

## Step 2: Add an entrypoint script

An entrypoint script must exist in our repository so that Docker has something to execute.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an entrypoint script and commit it to your branch

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, create a file in the `/action-a/` directory titled `entrypoint.sh`. You can do so with [this quicklink]({{ actionAUrl }})
1. Add the following content to the `entrypoint.sh` file. Later in this tutorial, **$INPUT_MY_NAME** is going to get a value from **MY_NAME**.

   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh -l

   sh -c "echo Hello world my name is $INPUT_MY_NAME"
   ```

1. Stage and commit the changes
1. Push the changes to GitHub
