Nice, you just added an action block to your workflow file! Here are some important details about _why_ each part of the block exists and _what_ each part does.

- `jobs:` is the base component of a workflow run
- `build:` is the identifier we're attaching to this job
- `name:` is the name of the job, this is displayed on GitHub when the workflow is running
- `steps:` the linear sequence of operations that make up a job
- `uses: actions/checkout@v1` uses a community action called [`checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to allow the workflow to access the contents of the repository
- `uses: ./action-a` provides the relative path the action we've created in the `action-a` directory of the repository
- `env`: is used to specify the environment variables that will be available to your action in the runtime environment. In this case, the environment variable is `MY_NAME`, and it is currently initialized to `"Mona"`.

### Your action has been triggered!

Your repository now contains an action (defined in the `/action-a/` folder) and a workflow (defined in the `./github/workflows/main.yml` file).

This action will run any time a new commit is created or pushed to the remote repository. Since you just created a commit, the workflow should have been triggered. This might take a few minutes since it's the first time running in this repository.

### Seeing your Action in action

The status of your action is shown here in the pull request (look for **All checks have passed** below), or you can click the "Actions" tab in your repository. From there you will see the actions that have run, and you can click on the action's "Log" link to view details.

## Step 5: Trigger the workflow

### :keyboard: Activity: See your action trigger the workflow

1. You've done the work, now sit back and see your action trigger the workflow!
