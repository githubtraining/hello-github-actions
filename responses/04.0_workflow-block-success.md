Nice work! :tada: You added a workflow!

Here's what it means:

- `name: A workflow for my Hello World file` gives your workflow a name. This name appears on any pull request or in the Actions tab. The name is especially useful when there are multiple workflows in your repository.
- `on: push` indicates that your workflow will execute anytime code is pushed to your repository, using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.

Next, we need to specify a job or jobs to run.

### Actions

Workflows piece together jobs, and jobs piece together steps. We'll now create a job that runs an action. Actions can be used from within the same repository, from any other public repository, or from a published Docker container image. We'll use an action that we'll define in this repository.

We'll add the block now, and break it down in the next step.

## Step 5: Run an action from your workflow file

Let's add the expected action to the workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an action block to your workflow file

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, [edit `.github/workflows/main.yml`]({{ workflowEditUrl }}) to append the following content:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       name: Hello world action
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v1
         - uses: ./action-a
           with:
             MY_NAME: "Mona"
   ```
1. Click **Start commit** in the top right of the workflow editor
1. Type your commit message and commit your changes directly to your branch

<details><summary>Trouble pushing?</summary>

The `main.yml` file cannot be edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.yml)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
