You merged and this course is now complete! I'll stop responding but the fun doesn't have to stop here. 

## Want to keep learning? 

In this repository:
- Your merge should trigger your action again, check it out in the [Actions tab]({{ repo }}/actions).
- The `Dockerfile` contains metadata for your action. Try changing some of that. You could, for example, change the icon that displays when the action is running.
- Change the `MY_NAME` environment variable to use your name instead of Mona's in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- Change the contents of `entrypoint.sh` to do output a different message.

Outside of this repository:
- Review the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions) on the GitHub Developer site. 
- Use existing actions from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions).
- Use existing actions from GitHub's [official list](https://github.com/actions).
- Use actions created by others in [awesome-actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions).

Now...[what will you learn next]({{ host }}/courses)?
