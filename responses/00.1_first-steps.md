### Actions and Workflows
There are two components to using GitHub Actions that we'll cover:
- the **action** itself
- a **workflow** that uses the action

A workflow can contain many actions, but each action has its own purpose. So, we'll put the files relating to the action in their own directory.

## Step 1: Creating a `Dockerfile`

Actions come in two types: Docker container and JavaScript. Our action will use a Docker container so it will require a `Dockerfile`. Let's add it now. We won't discuss what each line means in detail, but the important thing to know is that the action will be executed in an environment defined by this file.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a `Dockerfile` and open a pull request

1. Create a new branch
    - _Branches should be named intentionally, so a good name for this branch could be `first-action`_
1. On the new branch, create a directory: `action-a`
    - _Note:_ If you're working on GitHub.com, you can create a directory and a file at the same time by naming the file `action-a/Dockerfile`
1. In the `action-a` directory, create a file titled `Dockerfile`
1. Fill the `Dockerfile` with the content below:
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM debian:9.5-slim

    LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="Hello World"
    LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Write arguments to the standard output"
    LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="mic"
    LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="purple"

    LABEL "repository"="http://github.com/octocat/hello-world"
    LABEL "homepage"="http://github.com/actions"
    LABEL "maintainer"="Octocat <octocat@github.com>"

    ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
    ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
    ```
1. Stage and commit your file
    - If you're working locally, you will also need to push the branch to GitHub
1. Open a pull request with your new branch against `master`
