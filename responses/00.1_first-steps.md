### Actions and Workflows

There are two components to using GitHub Actions that we'll cover:

- the **action** itself
- a **workflow** that uses the action

A workflow can contain many actions, but each action has its own purpose. We'll put the files relating to the action in their own directory.

### Types of Actions

Actions come in two types: **container actions** and **JavaScript actions**.

Docker **container actions** allow the environment to be packaged with the GitHub Actions code and can only execute in the GitHub-Hosted Linux environment.

**JavaScript actions** decouple the GitHub Actions code from the environment allowing faster execution but accepting greater dependency management responsibility.

## Step 1: Add a `Dockerfile`

Our action will use a Docker container so it will require a `Dockerfile`. Let's add it now. We won't discuss what each line means in detail, but the important thing to know is that the action will be executed in an environment defined by this file.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a `Dockerfile` and open a pull request

1. Create a file titled `action-a/Dockerfile` by [using this quick link]({{ dockerfileUrl }}) or manually:
    - Create a new branch. _Branches should be named intentionally, so a good name for this branch could be `first-action`_.
    - On the new branch, create a directory: `action-a`. _Note:_ If you're working on GitHub.com, you can create a directory and a file at the same time by naming the file `action-a/Dockerfile`.
    - In the `action-a` directory, create a file titled `Dockerfile`.
1. Fill the `Dockerfile` with the content below:
    ```Dockerfile
    FROM debian:9.5-slim

    LABEL "com.github.actions.name"="Hello World"
    LABEL "com.github.actions.description"="Write arguments to the standard output"
    LABEL "com.github.actions.icon"="mic"
    LABEL "com.github.actions.color"="purple"

    LABEL "repository"="http://github.com/octocat/hello-world"
    LABEL "homepage"="http://github.com/actions"
    LABEL "maintainer"="Octocat <octocat@github.com>"

    ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
    RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
    ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
    ```
1. Commit your file
    - If you're working locally, you will also need stage your file and to push the branch to GitHub.
1. Open a pull request with your new branch against `master`
