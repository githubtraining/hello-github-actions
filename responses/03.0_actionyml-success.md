Next, we'll define a **workflow** that uses the GitHub Action.

### Workflow Files

[**Workflows**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) are defined in special files in the `.github/workflows` directory, named `main.yml`.

Workflows can execute based on your chosen event. For this lab, we'll be using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.

We'll break down each line of the workflow in the next step.

## Step 4: Start your workflow file

First, we'll add the structure of the workflow.

### :keyboard: Activity: Name and trigger your workflow

1. Create a file titled `.github/workflows/main.yml`. You can do so [using this quicklink]({{ worfkflowUrl}}) or manually:
   - As a part of this branch and pull request, create a `workflows` directory nested inside the `.github` directory.
   - In the new `.github/workflows/` directory, create a file titled `main.yml`
1. Add the following content to the `main.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   name: A workflow for my Hello World file
   on: push
   ```
1. Stage and commit the changes
1. Push the changes to GitHub

The `main.yml` file cannot be edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update main.yml)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
